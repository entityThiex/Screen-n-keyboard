A web application for playing Pen &amp; Paper. It's going to be fully available for selfhost once finished. 

## Story
Me and my friends play P&P, and as we are parting ways in the near future, and don't want our campaign to end, I wanted to create a web application, which will allow us to continue playing over the internet.
This project is oing to evolve in the future, but I will release stable version every now and then, so people can selfhost this on their pc/ server.
